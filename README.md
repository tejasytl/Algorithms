Assignment1: Polynomial Multiplication
Using the FFT/IFFT technique, you are required to multiply long integers (of say 1024 digits).
Develop a suitable data structure for representing such long integers.
Populate such data structures, as required, to obtain such integers with random digits, the number of digits to generate should be taken as a parameter. That way smaller integers may be generated for testing and larger integers may be generated for experimentation.

Assignmen2a: Divide and Conquer - 1
Given a n×n board where n is a power of 2 with minimum value as 2, with one missing cell (of size 1×1) at a known location, fill the board using L shaped tiles. An L shaped tile is a 2×2 square with one cell (of size 1×1) missing
Assignmen2b: Divide and Conquer - 2
Write an efficient program which takes as input the co-ordinates of n points and reports back the pair which is closest to each other.

Given the exact location and shape information of n buildings which lie on a fixed horizontal line in a 2-dimensional city, design an algorithm that reports the skyline of these buildings, eliminating hidden lines. The problem may be understood from the figures below. You need to solve the problem in two cities A and B. Buildings in each city have a fixed characteristic as explained below.
Assignment3a: Skylines - 1
City A remains sunny all year round. Each building is rectangular in shape and has a flat roof. A sample input and output is presented in the following figure. A building Bi is represented by a triple (li,ri,hi) where li and ri represent the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates of the building and hi represents the height. The input is a list of triples - one per building. The output is a list of pairs (x-coordinate and height) arranged in ascending order of x-coordinates representing the skyline.
Assignment3b: Skylines - 2
City B remains cold all year round and suffers from snowfall. Each building now has a slant roof in order to prevent snow from accumulating. A sample input and output is presented in the following figure. A building Bi is represented by a quadruple (li,hl,ri,hr) where li and ri represent the leftmost and rightmost x-coordinates of the building and hl and hr represents the corresponding heights. The input is now a list of quadruples - one per building. The output is again a list of pairs (x-coordinate and height) arranged in ascending order of x-coordinates representing the skyline.
